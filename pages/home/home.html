    I am a software developer that is currently working at SAIC a government cotractor. Because of this <br />
    I am unable to show you some of the work I have done. I have been working on a few projects in my spare time<br />
    and I would like to show you around. I have been working on a few games and web apps. I have also been<br />
    been working on a few things with SAIC but because of the nature of the work I am unable to show you.<br />
    I do have a Secret Clearance and I am able to work on classified projects.<br />
